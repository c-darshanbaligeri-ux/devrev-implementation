## Identification

To access certain features of the DevRev SDK, user identification is required.

The identification function should be placed appropriately in your app after the user logs in. If you have the user information available at app launch, call the function after the `DevRev.configure(appID)` method.

> **Tip:**
>   If you haven't previously identified the user, the DevRev SDK will automatically create an anonymous user for you immediately after the SDK is configured.

> **Tip:**
>   The `Identity` structure allows for custom fields in the user, organization, and account traits. These fields must be configured through the DevRev app before they can be used.

You can select from the following methods to identify users within your application:

### Identify an unverified user

The unverified identification method identifies users with a unique identifier, but it does not verify their identity with the DevRev backend.

```dart
DevRev.identifyUnverifiedUser(userID, organizationID);
```

### Identify a verified user

The verified identification method is used to identify users with an identifier unique to your system within the DevRev platform. The verification is done through a token exchange process between you and the DevRev backend.

The steps to identify a verified user are as follows:

1. Generate an AAT for your system (preferably through your backend).
2. Exchange your AAT for a session token for each user of your system.
3. Pass the user identifier and the exchanged session token to the `DevRev.identifyVerifiedUser(userID, sessionToken)` method.

  For security reasons, it is **strongly recommended** that the token exchange is executed on your backend to prevent exposing your application access token (AAT).

#### Generate an AAT

1. Open the DevRev web app at [https://app.devrev.ai](https://app.devrev.ai) and go to the **Settings** page.
2. Open the **Plug Tokens** page.
3. Under the **Application access tokens** panel, click **New token** and copy the token that's displayed.

  Ensure that you copy the generated application access token, as you cannot view it again.

#### Exchange your AAT for a session token

To proceed with identifying the user, you need to exchange your AAT for a session token. This step helps you identify a user of your own system within the DevRev platform.

Here is a simple example of an API request to the DevRev backend to exchange your AAT for a session token:

  Make sure that you replace the `` and `<YOUR_USER_ID>` with the actual values.

```bash
curl \
--location 'https://api.devrev.ai/auth-tokens.create' \
--header 'accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--header 'authorization: <AAT>' \
--data '{
  "rev_info": {
    "user_ref": "<YOUR_USER_ID>"
  }
}'
```

The response of the API call contains a session token that you can use with the verified identification method in your app.

  As a good practice, **your** app should retrieve the exchanged session token from **your** backend at app launch or any relevant app lifecycle event.

#### Identify the verified user

Pass the user identifier and the exchanged session token to the verified identification method:

```dart
DevRev.identifyVerifiedUser(userID, sessionToken);
```

### Update the user

You can update the user's information using the following method:

```dart
DevRev.updateUser(identity);
```

  The `userID` property cannot be updated.

Use this property to check whether the user is identified in the current session:

```dart
DevRev.isUserIdentified;
```

#### Logout

You can perform a logout of the current user by calling the following method:

```dart
DevRev.logout(deviceID);
```

The user is logged out by clearing their credentials, as well as unregistering the device from receiving push notifications, and stopping the session recording.

For example:

```dart
// Identify an anonymous user with a user identifier.
DevRev.identifyAnonymousUser("user@example.org");

// Identify an unverified user using their email address as the user identifier.
DevRev.identifyUnverifiedUser("user@example.org", "organization-1337");

// Identify a verified user using their email address as the user identifier.
DevRev.identifyVerifiedUser("foo@example.org", "bar-1337");

// Update the user's information.
DevRev.updateUser({"organizationRef": "organization-1337"});

// Logout the identified user.
DevRev.logout("dvc32423");
```

### Identity model

User identity information is passed as a `Map<String, dynamic>` to the `updateUser` method. The map can contain user, organization, and account information.

#### Properties

The identity map can contain the following properties:

| Property             | Type                    | Required | Description                                   |

| `customFields` | `Map<String, dynamic>?` | Dictionary of custom fields configured in DevRev |

## Plug support chat

Once user identification is complete, you can start using the chat (conversations) dialog supported by our DevRev SDK. The support chat feature can be shown as a modal screen from the top-most screen.

```dart
DevRev.showSupport();
```

#### Create a new support conversation

You can initiate a new support conversation directly from your app. This method displays the support chat screen and simultaneously creates a new conversation.

```dart
DevRev.createSupportConversation();
```

You can optionally pass a plain-text message to prefill the conversation input field:

```dart
DevRev.createSupportConversation(prefillMessage: "I need help with billing for order #12345");
```

## Handle in-app links

In certain cases, tapping links in the support chat opens them in the app instead of a browser. You can control whether the chat modal screen is dismissed after the link is opened by calling the following method:

```dart
DevRev.setShouldDismissModalsOnOpenLink(value);
```

Setting this flag to true applies the system's default behavior for opening links, which includes dismissing any DevRev modal screens to facilitate handling your own deep links.

## Configure dynamic theme

The DevRev SDK allows you to configure the theme dynamically based on the system appearance, or use the theme configured on the DevRev portal. By default, the theme is dynamic and follows the system appearance. Prefer setting the theme via `FeatureConfiguration.supportWidgetTheme` when calling `DevRev.configure` or `DevRev.updateFeatureConfiguration`. You can also use the legacy setter:

```dart
await DevRev.setPrefersSystemTheme(true);
```

## Analytics

The DevRev SDK allows you to send custom analytic events by using a properties map. You can track these events using the following function:

```dart
DevRev.trackEvent(name, properties);
```

For example:

```dart
DevRev.trackEvent("open-message-screen", {"id": "message-1337"});
```

> **Note:**
>   Event names must match the regular expression `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`. Use only letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens. Names containing other characters are rejected. Keep event names and properties small, because large payloads bloat the device's local memory and can lead to missed recordings.

## Track session analytics

The DevRev SDK offers session analytics features to help you understand how users interact with your app.

### Opt in or out

Session analytics features are opted-in by default, enabling them from the start. However, you can opt-out using the following method:

```dart
DevRev.stopAllMonitoring();
```

To opt back in, use the following method:

```dart
DevRev.resumeAllMonitoring();
```

### Session recording

You can enable session recording to record user interactions with your app.

  The session recording feature is opt-out and is enabled by default.

The session recording feature includes the following methods to control the recording:

| Method                                | Action                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DevRev.startRecording()`             | Starts the session recording.                                                                              |
| `DevRev.stopRecording()`              | Ends the session recording and uploads it to the portal.                                                   |
| `DevRev.pauseRecording()`             | Pauses the ongoing session recording.                                                                      |
| `DevRev.resumeRecording()`            | Resumes a paused session recording.                                                                        |
| `DevRev.processAllOnDemandSessions()` | Stops the ongoing session recording and uploads all offline sessions on demand, including the current one. |

### Session properties

You can add custom properties to the session recording to help you understand the context of the session. The properties are defined as a map of string values.

```dart
DevRev.addSessionProperties(properties);
```

To clear the session properties in scenarios such as user logout or when the session ends, use the following method:

```dart
DevRev.clearSessionProperties();
```

> **Warning:**
>   Avoid passing special characters in the session properties, as these characters can lead to file corruption and missed recordings.

### Mask sensitive data

Text fields are masked automatically, so you do not need to wrap them. This covers `TextField`, `TextFormField`, `CupertinoTextField`, and `SelectableText`.

Other elements, such as labels and buttons, are not masked automatically. Use the `DevRevMask` widget to mask them.

> **Note:**
>   The SDK does not automatically mask camera screens. If your app displays a camera preview or any camera-related UI, you must wrap it with `DevRevMask` manually to prevent it from being captured in session recordings.

For example:

```dart
DevRevMask(
  child: Text("Account balance: $1,234.56"),
)
```

### Unmask sensitive data

To unmask a masked view, use the `DevRevUnmask` widget. This also works on text fields that are masked automatically.

For example:

```dart
DevRevUnmask(
  child: TextField(
    decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: "foo-bar"),
    ),
  )
```

### Mask elements inside web views

Input views such as password text fields are automatically masked in web views.

To mark elements as sensitive inside a web view (`WebView`), apply the `devrev-mask` CSS class. To unmark them, use `devrev-unmask`.

* Mark an element as masked:
  ```html
  <label class="devrev-mask">OTP: 12345</label>
  ```
* Mark an element as unmasked:
  ```html
  <input type="text" placeholder="Enter Username" name="username" required class="devrev-unmask">
  ```

### Advanced session recording control while masking

For enhanced session recording and screen transition handling, you can use `DevRevMonitoredApp` as a drop-in replacement for `MaterialApp`. This widget automatically handles screen transition states and ensures proper masking during navigation.

> **Note:**
>   `DevRevMonitoredApp` is particularly useful when you want to avoid capturing snapshots during screen navigations, especially if any glitches occur. However, in most cases, this won't be necessary, as most of masking scenarios are not affected by standard navigation. This is an optional solution for enhanced control over session recording behavior.

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return DevRevMonitoredApp(
      title: "My App",
      theme: ThemeData(primarySwatch: Colors.blue),
      home: const HomeScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

When using `DevRevMonitoredApp.router` with GoRouter, add `DevRevTransitionTrackingObserver` to GoRouter's `observers` list to ensure proper transition tracking:

```dart
final router = GoRouter(
  routes: [...],
  observers: [DevRevTransitionTrackingObserver()],
);
```

### Track user interactions

The DevRev SDK automatically tracks user interactions such as taps, swipes, and scrolls. However, in some cases you may want to disable this tracking to prevent sensitive user actions from being recorded.

To temporarily disable user interaction tracking, use the following method:

```dart
DevRev.pauseUserInteractionTracking()
```

To resume user interaction tracking, use the following method:

```dart
DevRev.resumeUserInteractionTracking()
```

### Use timers

The DevRev SDK offers a timer mechanism to measure the time spent on specific tasks, allowing you to track events such as response time, loading time, or any other duration-based metrics.

The mechanism uses balanced start and stop methods, both of which accept a timer name and an optional dictionary of properties.

To start a timer, use the following method:

```dart
DevRev.startTimer(name, properties);
```

To stop a timer, use the following method:

```dart
DevRev.endTimer(name, properties);
```

For example:

```dart
DevRev.startTimer("response-time", {"id": "task-1337"});

// Perform the task that you want to measure.

DevRev.endTimer("response-time", {"id": "task-1337"});
```

### Timer usage examples

Measure the time a user spends on a screen. Start the timer in `initState` and end it in `dispose`:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  DevRev.startTimer("checkout-screen-time", {"screen": "checkout"});
}

@override
void dispose() {
  DevRev.endTimer("checkout-screen-time", {"screen": "checkout"});
  super.dispose();
}
```

Measure screen navigation time. Start the timer when navigation begins and end it after the destination renders:

```dart
// Navigation begins.
DevRev.startTimer("navigate-to-cart", {"from": "home"});
await Navigator.pushNamed(context, "/cart");

// Destination shown.
DevRev.endTimer("navigate-to-cart", {"from": "home"});
```

> **Warning:**
>   Avoid passing special characters in the timer properties, as these characters can lead to file corruption and missed recordings.

### Capture errors

You can report a handled error from a catch block using the `captureError` function.

This ensures that even if the error is handled in your app, it is still logged for diagnostics.

```dart
DevRev.captureError(
  error,
  tag,
)
```

For example:

```dart
try {
} catch (e) {
  DevRev.captureError(
    e,
    'network-failure',
  );
}
```

**Example with exception**

```dart
try {
  throw Exception('Something went wrong');
} catch (e) {
  DevRev.captureError(e, 'custom-error');
}
```

### Track screens

The DevRev SDK offers automatic screen tracking to help you understand how users navigate through your app. Although screens are automatically tracked, you can manually track screens using the following method:

```dart
DevRev.trackScreenName(screenName);
```

For example:

```dart
DevRev.trackScreenName("profile-screen");
```

### Manage screen transitions (Android only)

The DevRev SDK allows tracking of screen transitions to understand the user navigation within your app.
You can manually update the state using the following methods:

```dart
// Mark the transition as started.
DevRev.setInScreenTransitioning(true);

// Mark the transition as ended.
DevRev.setInScreenTransitioning(false);
```

## Push notifications

You can configure your app to receive push notifications from the DevRev SDK. The SDK is able to handle push notifications and execute actions based on the notification's content.

The DevRev backend sends push notifications to your app to notify users about new messages in the Plug support chat.

### Configuration

To receive push notifications, you need to configure your DevRev organization by following the instructions in the [push notifications](../push-notifications.md) section.

### Register for push notifications

> **Note:**
>   Push notifications require that the SDK has been configured and the user has been identified, to ensure delivery to the correct user.

The DevRev SDK offers a method to register your device for receiving push notifications. You can register for push notifications using the following method:

```dart
DevRev.registerDeviceToken(deviceToken, deviceID);
```

On Android devices, the `deviceToken` should be the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) token value, while on iOS devices, it should be the Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) token.

### Unregister from push notifications

If your app no longer needs to receive push notifications, you can unregister the device.

Use the following method to unregister the device:

```dart
DevRev.unregisterDevice(deviceID);
```

The method requires the device identifier, which should be the same as the one used when registering the device.

### Handle push notifications

#### Android

On Android, notifications are implemented as data messages to offer flexibility. However, this means that automatic click processing isn't available. To handle notification clicks, developers need to intercept the click event, extract the payload, and pass it to a designated method for processing. This custom approach enables tailored notification handling in Android applications.

To process the notification, use the following method:

```dart
DevRev.processPushNotification(payload);
```

#### iOS

On iOS devices, you must update the `AppDelegate` to intercept notification clicks and forward the payload to the SDK.

In `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`, set the `UNUserNotificationCenter` delegate:

```swift
UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self
```

Implement `userNotificationCenter(_:didReceive:)` to pass the notification payload to the SDK:

```swift
func userNotificationCenter(
    _ center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
    didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse
) async {
    await DevRev.processPushNotification(
        response.notification.request.content.userInfo
    )
}
```
