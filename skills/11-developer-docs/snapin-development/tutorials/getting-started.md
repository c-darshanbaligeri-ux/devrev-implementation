In this tutorial, you'll learn to create and deploy a snap-in. Additionally, you'll learn to create a snap-in version, installing from a version, deploying, deleting and upgrading the snap-in.

Snap-ins are collections of objects that extend DevRev's core platform value. These objects include automation, event sources, keyrings, custom types, and vistas. Snap-ins are packaged and installed separately from the DevRev core platform. To create your own snap-in, create a [dev org](https://app.devrev.ai/) where you will be installing your snap-in.

  ### Before you begin

  * Install [DevRev CLI](../references/cli-install.md)
  * Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq)

  ### Log in to DevRev for authentication

  To authenticate, run the following command:

  ```bash
  devrev profiles authenticate -o <dev-org-slug> -u <youremail@yourdomain.com>
  ```

  ### Initialize a snap-in template

  To initialize a snap-in template, run the following command:

  ```bash
  devrev snap_in_version init
  ```

  After the command runs, a new folder `devrev-snaps-typescript-template` is
  created in the filesystem.

  ```
  devrev-snaps-typescript-template/
  ├── code
  │   ├── babel.config.js
  │   ├── jest.config.js
  │   ├── nodemon.json
  │   ├── package.json
  │   ├── src
  │   │   ├── fixtures
  │   │   │   └── on_work_created_event.json
  │   │   ├── function-factory.ts
  │   │   ├── functions
  │   │   │   └── on_work_creation
  │   │   │       ├── index.test.ts
  │   │   │       └── index.ts
  │   │   ├── index.ts
  │   │   ├── main.ts
  │   │   └── test-runner
  │   │       ├── example.test.ts
  │   │       └── test-runner.ts
  │   ├── tsconfig.eslint.json
  │   └── tsconfig.json
  ├── manifest.yaml
  └── README.md
  ```

  The command creates a folder `devrev-snaps-typescript-template`. This contains a `manifest.yaml` file and a `code` folder.

  * `manifest` file defines the resources to be created on the DevRev platform. For detailed information on the various components of a manifest file, see [Snap-in Manifest](../references/manifest.md).
  * `code` folder consists of sample starter code for snap-ins. For detailed information on how to get started, see [starter example repo](https://github.com/devrev/snap-in-examples/tree/main/1-starter/code#readme).

  ### Create a snap-in package

  To create a [snap-in package](../concepts.md), run the following command:

  ```bash
  devrev snap_in_package create-one --slug my-first-snap-in | jq .
  ```

  > **Note:**
>     1. The slug is globally unique. If the slug provided is already taken, a conflict error occurs. This can be resolved by provided a different slug.
>     2. On successful creation, the CLI automatically stores the package ID in its context corresponding to the slug. For more information, refer to the [Snap-in Context](../references/cli.md#snap-in-context).
>

  ### Create a snap-in version

  To create a [snap-in version](../references/cli.md#snap-in-version), run the following command:

  ```bash
  devrev snap_in_version create-one --path ./devrev-snaps-typescript-template
  ```

  Output:

  ```json
  {
      "id":"don:integration:dvrv-us-1:devo/fOFb0IdZ:snap_in_package/972696ef-32cf-4ec0-81da-5a4a7804fa91:snap_in_version/52c058a9-7d68-4538-b70e-46efc7dfcd0d",
      ...... ,
      "state":"draft"
  }
  ```

  > **Info:**
>     The CLI automatically stores the version ID in its context. Refer to the [Snap-in Context](../references/cli.md#snap-in-context) section for more information.
>

  In a package that's not published to the marketplace, you can have only one snap-in version. If you have an existing snap-in version in the package, the following error message is shown:

  ```json
  {
    "debug_message": "can't create a new snap_in_version under snap_in_package <ID> because there is already a non-published snap_in_version under it",
    "message": "Bad Request",
    "type": "bad_request"
  }
  ```

  To list snap-in versions under the package, run the following command:

  ```bash
  devrev snap_in_version list
  ```

  To delete the snap-in version, run the following command:

  ```bash
  devrev snap_in_version delete-one
  ```

  ### Install a snap-in from a snap-in version

  To create a snap-in from a snap-in version, run the following command:

  ```bash
  devrev snap_in draft
  ```

  > **Note:**
>     1. To install the snap-in, you must be a member of the **Admins** group in the dev org.
>     2. If you get a `snap-in version is not ready` error, check the version state with `devrev snap_in_version show`. The state should be `ready` for installation. If `build_failed`, check the logs for errors.
>

  

  > **Info:**
>     The CLI automatically stores the snap-in ID in its context. Refer to the [Snap-in Context](../references/cli.md#snap-in-context) section for more information.
>

  ### Configure the snap-in

  The snap-in is installed in draft state. It may require some configuration before it can be deployed.

  You can access snap-in configuration by using the URL generated by the draft command, or by navigating to the snap-ins page in the DevRev app.

  Follow the configuration steps for the snap-in to setup keyrings and inputs if any.

  > **Info:**
>     Private keyrings from other creators aren't listed.
>

  To make a connection available to other members in your organization, create it with the **visible to dev org** option set to true while creating the connection in the DevRev app.

  ### Deploy the snap-in

  Once you have provided the required configuration, the **Deploy snap-in** button is enabled on the UI. Click on it to deploy the snap-in.
  That's it, the snap-in should now be active and ready to use.

  ### Check snap-in logs

  To check the logs for the snap-in, run the following command:

  ```bash
  devrev snap_in_package logs | jq
  ```

  ### Delete the snap-in

  The snap-in can be deleted from the UI or run the following command:

  ```bash
  devrev snap_in delete-one [snap-in id]
  ```

  If any deactivate hook is specified, it's invoked with `is_deletion=true`.

  ### Upgrade the snap-in

  Once you deploy and test your snap-in, you may want to make changes to it. The changes can be done using a single command.

  ```bash
  devrev snap_in_version upgrade --path ./
  ```

  The above expects the manifest file to be present in the current directory by the name `manifest.yaml` and the code to be present in the `code` directory.

  Refer to [upgrade command](../upgrade-snap-ins.md) for more information.
