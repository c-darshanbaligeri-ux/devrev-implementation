## Introduction

In this tutorial, you learn how to develop a snap-in that mirrors an issue from DevRev to GitHub. This requires addition of a command that can be run from the **Discussions** tab of an issue in DevRev, which creates an issue in GitHub.

## Background context

1. **GitHub APIs mastery:**

   * Delve into understanding GitHub [APIs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest).
   * Learn how to fetch details and perform actions using GitHub APIs.

2. **Secrets and keyrings in DevRev snap-ins:**

   * Explore the usage of secrets and refer to
     [keyrings](../references/keyrings/keyring-intro.md) in DevRev snap-ins.

3. **Command creation and utilization in DevRev:**
   * Gain proficiency in creating and using
     [commands](../references/commands.md) in DevRev.

  ### Installation guide

  * Install [DevRev CLI](../references/cli-install.md)
  * Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq).
  * Install [DevRev SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devrev/typescript-sdk?activeTab=readme)

  > **Info:**
>     If you did not follow the [getting started](getting-started.md) tutorial then follow these steps to authenticate and initialize the snap-in TypeScript template:

    ```bash
    devrev profiles authenticate -o <dev-org-slug> -u <youremail@yourdomain.com>
    ```

    ```bash
    devrev snap_in_version init
    ```
  

  #### Trigger

  To initiate the process of creating a GitHub issue directly from a DevRev issue, a trigger mechanism is essential. In this context, the implementation involves the introduction of a specialized command. This command is designed to be executed exclusively from the discussion section of a DevRev issue, serving as the catalyst for replicating the issue on GitHub.

  #### Action

  The primary action involves leveraging the issue creation API provided by GitHub. This API is utilized to create the GitHub issue seamlessly from the corresponding issue in DevRev.

  ### Creating the snap-in

  #### Updating the manifest

  To outline the structure of the snap-in, the initial step is to define key attributes in the snap-in's manifest. Begin by specifying the name, description, and account display name for the snap-in.

  ```yml
  version: "2"
  name: "GitHub issue creator"
  description: "Replicate DevRev issues in GitHub."

  service_account:
    display_name: GitHub Issue Creator
  ```

  ### Keyrings

  To facilitate authentication for our API calls, the initial step involves creating a Personal Access Token (PAT) in GitHub. This PAT can be stored as a [connection](../references/keyrings/keyring-intro.md) within DevRev. Subsequently, this
  connection is employed within our snap-in in the form of keyrings.

  ```yml
  keyrings:
    organization:
      - name: github_connection
        display_name: Github Connection
        description: Github PAT
        types:
          - snap_in_secret
  ```

  ### Functions and commands

  Having established the foundational configurations, the subsequent step is to define the functions and commands responsible for orchestrating the core logic of the snap-in.

  ```yaml
  functions:
    - name: command_handler
      description: Function to create a GitHub issue
  ```

  The command states where you can use it. For example, in the **Discussions** tab of issues.

  It also explains the different situations and ways in which you can make use of this command.

  ```yml
  commands:
    - name: gh_issue
      namespace: devrev
      description: Command to create a GitHub issue.
      surfaces:
        - surface: discussions
          object_types:
            - issue
      usage_hint: "[OrgName] [RepoName]"
      function: command_handler
  ```

  To utilize this command, execute `/gh_issue OrgName RepoName` in the **Discussions** tab of the issue. Within the function logic, validations are implemented to ensure the correctness of both the organization name (`OrgName`) and repository
  name (`RepoName`) before proceeding with the issue creation.

  ### Function logic

  After creating the manifest and establishing the snap-in's logic, the next step is to define the function logic that handles the business logic. Once you understand the payload structure of a command, you can proceed with its implementation.

  To proceed, define the handler function for command events.

  ```ts
  const handleEvent = async (event: any) => {
    // Function logic goes here.
  };
  ```

  Within this handler, the initial step involves extracting the GitHub token provided as input in the keyring. Subsequently, the [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js), responsible for managing GitHub API requests, is initialized:

  ```ts
  const githubPAT = event.input_data.keyrings.github_connection;
  const octokit = new Octokit({
    auth: githubPAT,
  });
  ```

  To facilitate authentication for DevRev API calls, a DevRev token is required.
  The initialization process for the DevRev SDK involves using the received endpoint.

  ```ts
  const devrevToken = event.context.secrets.service_account_token;
  const endpoint = event.execution_metadata.devrev_endpoint;
  const devrevSDK = client.setup({
    endpoint: endpoint,
    token: devrevToken,
  });
  ```

  With the SDKs successfully initialized, the next step is to invoke the necessary
  APIs.

  As a preliminary step, the required fields for creating a GitHub Issue, namely **title** and **body**, need to be extracted. These details are sourced from the issue.

  To facilitate this, introduce a function defined for this specific purpose:

  ```ts
  const getIssueDetails = async (workId: string, devrevSDK: any) => {
    try {
      // Get the issue details from the database using the workId
      const workItemResp = await devrevSDK.worksGet({
        id: workId,
      });
      const workItem = workItemResp.data.work;

      // Populate the issue details
      const issueDetails = {
        description: workItem.body,
        issueDisplayName: workItem.display_id,
        title: workItem.title,
      };
      return issueDetails;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      throw new Error("Failed to get issue details");
    }
  };
  ```

  Now, the function can be called within the handler function to obtain the necessary issue details::

  ```ts
  const workId = event.payload.source_id;
  const issueDetails = await getIssueDetails(workId, devrevSDK);
  ```

  Following this, the next step involves parsing the parameters `Organization` and
  `Repository Name` that were passed in the command:

  ```ts
  const getOrgAndRepoNames = (paramString: string): string[] => {
    const paramList = paramString.split(" ");
    if (paramList.length !== 2) {
      throw new Error("Invalid Parameters");
    }
    const [orgName, repoName] = paramList;
    return [orgName, repoName];
  };
  ```

  The GitHub REST API ([https://docs.github.com/en/rest/orgs/orgs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-an-organization](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/orgs/orgs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-an-organization)) is used to confirm the specified organisation name.

  ```ts
  const verifyOrgName = async (orgName: string, octokit: Octokit) => {
    try {
      await octokit.request("GET /orgs/{org}", {
        headers: {
          "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",
        },
        org: orgName,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      throw new Error("Invalid Organisation Name");
    }
  };
  ```

  Similarly, the [GET Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-repository) is used to validate whether the entered repository name is correct.

  ```ts
  const verifyRepoName = async (
    orgName: string,
    repoName: string,
    octokit: Octokit
  ) => {
    try {
      await octokit.request("GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}", {
        headers: {
          "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",
        },
        owner: orgName,
        repo: repoName,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      throw new Error("Invalid Repository Name");
    }
  };
  ```

  After completing all the necessary verifications, the [POST create issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/issues?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-an-issue) can be invoked to create a new issue.

  ```ts
  const createGitHubIssue = async (
    orgName: string,
    repoName: string,
    issueDetails: any,
    octokit: Octokit
  ) => {
    try {
      await octokit.request("POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues", {
        body: issueDetails.description,
        headers: {
          "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",
        },
        owner: orgName,
        repo: repoName,
        title: "[" + issueDetails.issueDisplayName + "] " + issueDetails.title,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      throw new Error("Failed to create issue");
    }
  };
  ```

  The completion of functional logic is a key milestone in the process. After laying the framework, now you'll learn how to install this snap-in for your organization.

  ### Deploying the snap-in to your organization

  Once the code has been validated, the next steps involve creating the snap-in version and subsequently creating the snap-in itself. Before installing the snap-in, it's essential to set up a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) and add it to the connections in DevRev as a snap-in secret. Ensure that the secret is shared within the organization so that the snap-in can utilize it.

  Follow these steps to install the snap-in in your organization:

  #### Step 1: Create a GitHub personal access token

  Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) by following the steps outlined in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

  #### Step 2: Add PAT to DevRev connections

  Add the generated PAT as a snap-in secret in DevRev. This secret is used during the installation of the snap-in. Ensure that the secret is shared within the organization to allow the snap-in to access it.

  #### Step 3: Install the snap-in

  During the installation of the snap-in, utilize the shared secret to authenticate and connect with GitHub. This ensures that the snap-in has the necessary permissions to interact with GitHub APIs.
