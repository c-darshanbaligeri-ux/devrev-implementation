# Using a snap-in to perform a DevRev action

Scraped: 2026-11-03

## Introduction

The objective is to build a snap-in that creates a new ticket every 10 minutes.

## Background context

The [Getting Started](getting-started.md) tutorial creates a hello-world snap-in which prints a log message when a work item is created.
This tutorial makes the following changes to the snap-in:

1. Update the trigger condition to run every 10 minutes instead of work
   creation.
2. Create a ticket whenever the snap-in is triggered.

Ensure that you have at least one [part](https://support.devrev.ai/devrev/article/ART-21849) in your organization since every
ticket must be linked to a part and have an owner.

Since a DevRev ticket is created whenever the function is triggered,
DevRev APIs need to be called that allow this
functionality. Although one can directly make HTTP requests to the endpoint,
it's strongly suggested to use the
[DevRev TypeScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devrev/typescript-sdk)
since it provides additional types and helper methods which ease development.

  ### Installation guide

  * Install [DevRev CLI](../references/cli-install.md)
  * Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq)
  * Install [DevRev SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devrev/typescript-sdk?activeTab=readme)

  > **Info:**
>     If you did not follow the [getting started](getting-started.md) tutorial then follow these steps to authenticate and initialize the snap-in TypeScript template:

    ```bash
    devrev profiles authenticate -o <dev-org-slug> -u <youremail@yourdomain.com>
    ```

    ```bash
    devrev snap_in_version init
    ```
  

  #### Trigger

  The trigger condition for the snap-in is dictated by the
  [Event Sources](../references/event-sources.md)
  section in the manifest. The [`timer-events`](../references/event-sources.md#timer-based-event-sources)
  event source is suitable for the use-case, since it allows trigger of snap-ins
  using [CRON expression](https://crontab.guru/).

  #### Action

  The hello-world snap-in prints a log message whenever the snap-in is triggered.
  Here, the snap-in should create a work-item of type ticket when triggered. To do
  that, use the
  [DevRev TypeScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devrev/typescript-sdk) to
  make API calls for creating the ticket.

  ### Creating the snap-in

  #### Updating the manifest

  Update the manifest file to reflect the objective. Update the name, the
  description, and the service account's display name to better reflect the
  snap-in's behavior.

  ```yaml title="manifest.yaml"
  version: "2"

  name: "Timely Ticketer"
  description: "Snap-in to create ticket every 10 minutes"

  service_account:
      display_name: Automatic Ticket Creator Bot
  ```

  Next, update the `event_sources` section to use the `timer-events` event source.
  The `timer-events` source type takes a `config` of type `cron` or
  `interval_seconds` as mentioned in the
  [documentation](../references/event-sources.md#timer-based-event-sources).
  The `cron` config is used here.

  ```yaml title="manifest.yaml"

  event_sources:
      organization:
          - name: timer-event-source
            description: Event source that sends events every 10 minutes.
            display_name: Timer Event Source
            type: timer-events
            config:
              # CRON expression for triggering every 10 minutes.
              cron: "*/10 * * * *"
              metadata:
                  event_key: ten_minute_event
  ```

  Finally, update the `function` name to better reflect the behavior and
  `automation`name to use the event type corresponding to the `timer-events` event
  source.

  ```yaml title="manifest.yaml"
  functions:
      - name: ticket_creator
        description: Function to create a new ticket when triggered.

  automations:
      - name: periodic_ticket_creator
        description: Automation to create a ticket every 10 minutes
        source: timer-event-source
        event_types:
          - timer.tick
        function: ticket_creator
  ```

  After these changes, the final version of the manifest can be found
  [here](https://github.com/devrev/snap-in-examples/blob/main/6-timer-ticket-creator/manifest.yaml).

  ### Renaming the function

  Next, the function name in the `src/functions` folder needs to be renamed to
  'ticket\_creator' which is the one put in the manifest.

  ```
  src/functions/on_work_created => src/functions/ticket_creator
  ```

  These changes need to be reflected in the following files as well:

  * `src/function-factory.ts`
  * `src/test-runner/example.test.ts`
  * `src/functions/ticket_creator/index.test.ts`

  ### Event received by the snap-in function

  In the hello-world snap-in, the ID of the created work-item gets extracted from
  the input event as such.

  ```js
  console.info(
    `The work ${events[0].payload.work_created.work.id} has been created.`
  );
  ```

  The schema for a event received by the snap-in is:

  ```ts
  {
   payload:Record<string,any>
   context: {
      "dev_oid": string,
      "source_id":string,
      "snap_in_id": string,
      "snap_in_version_id":string,
      "service_account_id":string,
      "secrets": {
          "service_account_token": [SECRET],
          ...
      },
   },
   execution_metadata: {
      "request_id":string,
      "function_name": string,
      "event_type": string,
      "devrev_endpoint": string
   },
   input_data: {
      "global_values": Record<string,string>,
      "event_sources":Record<string,string>,
      "keyrings":Record<string,string>,
      "resources": Record<string,string>
   }
  }
  ```

  The `payload` differs by the `event_source` and the `event_type` received. There
  are two fields to be concerned about in the input payload:

  1. `devrev_endpoint` the endpoint of the API call.
  2. `service_account_token` which is a short-lived token provisioned by each
     snap-in. This is required when making API calls to DevRev.

  ### Updating the code

  Update the code in `src/functions/ticket_creator/index.ts` to reflect the
  behavior.

  Firstly, import the DevRev TypeScript SDK in the `index.ts` file

  ```ts title="index.ts"
  import {client, publicSDK} from "@devrev/typescript-sdk";
  ```

  Next, update the `run` function in the hello-world example. Since the ticket
  gets created frequently, set some creation time in the title and the body. The
  example uses the part as `PROD-1` and keeps the owner as `DEVU-1`. Feel free to
  edit those values to actual IDs for parts and users in your dev org.

  The complete `index.ts` file looks like this

  ```ts
  import { client, publicSDK } from "@devrev/typescript-sdk";

  export const run = async (events: any[]) => {
    for (const event of events) {
      const endpoint = event.execution_metadata.devrev_endpoint;
      const token = event.context.secrets.service_account_token;

      // Initialize the public SDK client
      const devrevSDK = client.setup({ endpoint, token });

      // Create a ticket. Name the ticket using the current date and time.
      const date = new Date();
      const ticketName = `Ticket created at ${date.toLocaleString()}`;
      const ticketBody = `This ticket was created by a snap-in at ${date.toLocaleString()}`;

      const response = await devrevSDK.worksCreate({
        title: ticketName,
        body: ticketBody,
        // The ticket is created in the PROD-1 part. Rename this to match your part.
        applies_to_part: "PROD-1",
        // The ticket is owned by the DEVU-1 user. Rename this to match the required user.
        owned_by: ["DEVU-1"],
        type: publicSDK.WorkType.Ticket,
      });

      console.log(response);
    }
  };

  export default run;
  ```

  ### Deploying the snap-in to your organization

  Once satisfied with the code changes, move to the `code` folder, and run

  ```bash
  npm install

  npm run build

  npm run package

  ```

  This builds and packages your snap-in and creates a `build.tar.gz`. The `tar.gz`
  and `manifest.yaml` file is used when creating the snap-in version.

  > **Note:**
>     Always remember to build and package the snap-in whenever there are code changes
>     and it needs to be re-deployed.
>

  Steps for deploying this snap-in have been discussed in the
  [Getting Started](getting-started.md) section.
